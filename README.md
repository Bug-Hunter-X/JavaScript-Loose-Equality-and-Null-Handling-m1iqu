# JavaScript Loose Equality and Null Handling

This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript error related to loose equality (==) and the handling of null values.  The `bug.js` file contains code that incorrectly handles null values using loose equality.  The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version that uses strict equality (===) for accurate comparison and avoids unexpected behavior.

## Problem

The original code uses loose equality (==) to check for null values. This can lead to unexpected results if the variable has a value that is loosely equal to null but not strictly equal.
